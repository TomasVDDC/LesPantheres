## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis of flight delay data reveals key insights: the average delay is 12.7 minutes, with a high standard deviation of 44 minutes indicating varied delay lengths. Most flights are on time, as the median delay is 0 minutes, yet the maximum delay recorded is significantly high at 7,223 minutes. Notably, 37.25% of the data on departure delays is missing, highlighting the need for careful data handling. 

Here is a table summarising the key insights:


| Statistic                 | Departure Delays (minutes)   | 
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Mean                      | 12.7           | 
| Standard Deviation        | 44            | 
| Minimum                   | 0                 | 
| 25%                       | 0             | 
| 50% (Median)              | 0            | 
| 75%                       | 5            | 
| Maximum                   | 7.223            | 
| Missing Values (%)        | 37.25            | 


The accompanying visualization showcases trends in average flight delays from 2018 to 2022, providing a basis for understanding delay patterns and aiding in improving airline operational efficiency. Notice the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic during 2020!
